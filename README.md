# SunTech (startechlite)
SunTech is a project for the database course CSE216 of L2T2. The purpose of this project is to use databases to emulate a real world application. In this project we use databases in a webapp that sells tech products, mainly PC components.

## Running on your PC
#### 1. Cloning repo

#### 2. Downloading images
The images for this webapp exceed github's file size restriction, so you have to download them from the following google drive link:
[SunTech Images](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-tysqCQBnzjx3oBqQWv6LcE-A8N-R-kM?usp=sharing).\\
The downloaded `products` folder will contain the images. Put this folder in the following directory **relative** to the project root:
`startechlite/static/img/`\\
So after putting `products` in the appropriate directory the folders containing the images should be in:
`startechlite/static/img/products/`\\
